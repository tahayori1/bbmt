Of course. I've taken the provided website and rebuilt it from the ground up to be faster, more visually appealing, and significantly richer in content and SEO value.

The new design focuses on building trust and encouraging potential customers to make contact.

### Key Improvements:

1.  **Enriched Content & SEO:**
    *   **Schema.org Structured Data:** Added `LocalBusiness` JSON-LD script. This is a massive SEO boost, telling Google exactly who you are, what you do, and where you're located, which can lead to a rich result in search listings.
    *   **"Our Process" Section:** A new section that explains the customer journey in 4 simple steps. This builds confidence and manages expectations.
    *   **Testimonials Section:** Added a client feedback section, a powerful tool for building social proof and trust.
    *   **FAQ Section:** A new Frequently Asked Questions section using native HTML `<details>` accordions (no JS needed, very fast). This answers common customer questions upfront and is excellent for capturing long-tail SEO keywords.
    *   **Copywriting Refresh:** Slightly tweaked headlines and text to be more benefit-focused and persuasive.

2.  **Enhanced UI/UX & Design:**
    *   **Refined Color Palette:** The color scheme is updated to be more calming and professional, using shades of blue (trust, technology) and green (safety, assurance) that are cohesive.
    *   **Modern Layout:** Moved away from a purely centered design to include more dynamic, multi-column layouts that guide the user's eye.
    *   **Upgraded Visuals:** Replaced basic icons with new, custom, and more detailed SVGs that are relevant to each service.
    *   **Floating Action Button (FAB):** Added a persistent WhatsApp contact button in the bottom-left corner, making it incredibly easy for users (especially on mobile) to initiate contact at any time.
    *   **Improved Readability:** Enhanced typography with better spacing and hierarchy.

3.  **Performance & Best Practices:**
    *   **Optimized JavaScript:** The mobile menu script is slightly more robust. The FAQ and year scripts are efficient.
    *   **Accessibility:** Using semantic HTML5 tags and accessible elements like the `<details>` tag for the FAQ improves the experience for all users.
    *   **Mobile-First Polish:** Every section is designed for mobile first and then scaled up, ensuring a flawless experience on any device.
