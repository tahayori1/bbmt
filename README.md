I will start by creating the foundational HTML structure for the website, including the head section with essential SEO meta tags, title, and links to Tailwind CSS and any custom stylesheets. Then, I will design the header, incorporating the provided logo and a mobile-friendly navigation menu. Immediately following, I will develop a compelling hero section featuring one of the main images and a strong call-to-action.
Next, I will create the "Our Products" section, showcasing each product with its image, name, and a concise description in a clean, mobile-friendly layout.
Then, I will design the "About Us" section, structuring the introduction, vision, mission, and values in an easily readable format, followed by the "Our History" section, presenting the family's business journey in a chronological, visually engaging timeline.
After that, I will create the "Humanity First" section to highlight the company's charitable contributions, and then design a clear and comprehensive "Contact Us" section with all the provided details and social media links.
Finally, I will assemble all sections into a single, cohesive HTML file, ensuring mobile-first responsiveness, applying SEO best practices, and implementing performance optimizations before outputting the complete website code. I will now proceed with the first step.
